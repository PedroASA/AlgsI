### Merging with smaller auxiliary array

<hr>

Suppose that the subarray __a[0]__ to __a[n−1]__ is sorted and the subarray __a[n]__ to __a[2∗n−1]__ is sorted. How can you merge the two subarrays so that __a[0]__ to __a[2∗n−1]__ is sorted using an auxiliary array of length __n__ (instead of __2n__) ?
