### Search in a bitonic array
<hr>

An array is bitonic if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of integers followed immediately by a decreasing sequence of integers. Write a program that, given a bitonic array of nn distinct integer values, determines whether a given integer is in the array.

* Standard version: Use ∼3lg**N** compares in the worst case.
* Signing bonus: Use ∼2lg**N** compares in the worst case (and prove that no algorithm can guarantee to perform fewer than ∼2lg**N** compares in the worst case).
