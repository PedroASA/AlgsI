#### Given an array of nn buckets, each containing a red, white, or blue pebble, sort them by color. The allowed operations are:

* _swap(i,j)_:  swap the pebble in bucket **i** with the pebble in bucket **j**.
* _color(i)_: determine the color of the pebble in bucket ii.

#### The performance requirements are as follows:

* At most __n__ calls to _color()_.
* At most __n__ calls to _swap()_.
* Constant extra space.
