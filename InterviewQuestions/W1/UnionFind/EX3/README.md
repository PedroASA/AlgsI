### Successor with delete
<hr>

Given a set of __N__ integers **S={0,1,...,n−1}** and a sequence of requests of the following form:

* _Remove_ **x** from __S__
* _Find_ the successor of **x**: the smallest __y__ in **S** such that __y__ ≥ __x__.
Design a data type so that all operations (except construction) take logarithmic time or better in the worst case.
