### Social network connectivity. 
<hr>

Given a social network containing __N__ members and a log file containing __M__ timestamps at which times pairs of members formed friendships, design an algorithm to determine the earliest time at which all members are connected (i.e., every member is a friend of a friend of a friend ... of a friend). Assume that the log file is sorted by timestamp and that friendship is an equivalence relation. The running time of your algorithm should be **M**log**N** or better and use extra space proportional to __N__.
