### Egg drop 
<hr>

Suppose that you have an nn-story building (with floors 1 through **N**) and plenty of eggs. An egg breaks if it is dropped from floor __T__ or higher and does not break otherwise. Your goal is to devise a strategy to determine the value of  __T__ given the following limitations on the number of eggs and tosses:

* Version 0: 1 egg and ≤ **T** tosses. 
* Version 1:  ∼1lg**N** eggs and  ∼1lg**N** tosses. 
* Version 2: ∼lg**T** eggs and  ∼2lg**T** tosses.
* Version 3: 2 eggs and  ∼2sqrt(**N**) tosses.
* Version 4: 2 eggs and  ≤ **C**sqrt(**T**) tosses for some fixed constant __C__.
